# TO-DO-LIST-
This project manages a To-Do List with features like adding, deleting, marking tasks as completed, filtering, and saving tasks in local storage.

Main Features:
Add Task

When the "Add" button is clicked, a new task is added to the list.
Task includes a complete button (✔️) and a delete button (🗑️).
Task is also saved in local storage.
Delete & Complete Tasks

Clicking the trash button removes the task from the list and local storage.
Clicking the check button marks the task as completed (crossed out).
Filter Tasks

Options to show all, completed, or incomplete tasks.
Save & Retrieve from Local Storage

Tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
When the page loads, saved tasks are retrieved and displayed.
This makes the To-Do List interactive and persistent. 🚀
